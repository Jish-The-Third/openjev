Hello, we are looking for programmers for OpenJev Project. 
Our programmers must know some JavaScript, whether a little or a lot, must have access to a Computer some of the time. 
We would love it if you joined us! Read more below:

## What we're looking for
- People who know at minimium what pathfinding is, and are able to fix our code

- Know what packages are and how to install them
